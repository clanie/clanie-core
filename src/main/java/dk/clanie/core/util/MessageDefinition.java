/**
 * Message Interface.
 * 
 * When using <code>String</code> constants to refer to messages
 * in ResourceBundles (property files), it's easy to forget to
 * define a message and to make typos in it's key when referring
 * to it.
 * 
 * If you declare all your message keys in an <code>enum</code>
 * which implements this interface, and define them all in one
 * ResourceBundle (or property file), you can use
 * {@link MessageEnumTest} to test that you aren't
 * referring to non-existing message definitions. It will also
 * check if the ResourceBundle has unused entries in it.
 * 
 * For an example of how to do this, refer to the unit-test
 * <code>MessageEnumTestTest</code>.
